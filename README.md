## Project Description
preView is a music playlist app that uses the Deezer API to allow users to create their own playlists. These playlists are fully customizable and multiple playlists can be created for a given user.  Using the preView app, a user can search for any song on the Deezer API and listen to a short segment of the song.  These searched songs can also be added to user playlists and deleted from a playlist should they already exist in it. These playlists can also be deleted, regardless of how many songs are on it.
